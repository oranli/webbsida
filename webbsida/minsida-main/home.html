    Drain Gang is a swedish artistic collective based in Stockholm. It started in 2013 when the 5 members Bladee, Ecco2k, Thaiboy, Yung Sherman and Whitearmor decided to join together
    due to their shared interest in the same Music. After SadBoy's Yung Lean, released his debut EP 'Lavender' he blew up underground. Following this popularity Bladee joined Yung Lean on the track 'Nitevision' and 'Heal you // Bladerunner'.
    Both tracks were quite well received and Bladee started gaining traction and their collaborations grew more frequent. Lean would frequently cross the groups in albums and projects and they rose to fame together.
